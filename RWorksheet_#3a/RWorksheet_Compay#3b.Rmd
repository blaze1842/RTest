1. Create a data frame using the table below.
a. Write the codes.
```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  Respondents = 1:20, 
  Sex = c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2),
  Fathers_Occupaton = c(1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,1,2,1),
  Persons_at_Home = c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6), 
Siblings_at_School = c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2),
Types_of_Houses =c(1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2)
)
data
```
b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
```{r}
str(data)
summary(data)
```
c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
```{r}
mean_for_siblings <- mean(data$Siblings_at_School)
mean_for_siblings
```
d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions.
Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
subset_data <- subset(data, Respondents <= 2)

subset_data
```
e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
subset_rows_e <- data[c(3, 5), c(2, 4)]
subset_rows_e
```
f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses.
Write the codes.
```{r}
types_houses <- data$Types_of_Houses
types_houses
```
g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the
codes and its output.
```{r}
males_farmers <- data[data$Sex == 1 & data$Fathers_Occupaton,]
males_farmers
```
h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of
siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.
```{r}
female_siblings <- data[data$Sex == 2 & data$Siblings_at_School >= 5,]
female_siblings
```
2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:

a. Describe the results.
```{r}
df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
Doubles = double(), Characters=character(),
Logicals = logical(),
Factors = factor(),
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))
```
3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv
a. Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.
```{r}
HouseData1 <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")
HouseData1
```
b. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend: Male = 1 and Female = 2]. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}
HouseData1$Sex <- as.numeric(factor(HouseData1$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female")))
HouseData1
```
c. Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood = 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3]. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}
HouseData1$Types_of_Houses <- as.numeric(factor(HouseData1$Types_of_Houses, levels = c("Wood", "Congrete", "Semi-congrete")))
HouseData1
```
d. On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. What is the R code and its output?
```{r}
HouseData1$Fathers_Occupation <- as.character(factor(HouseData1$Fathers_Occupation, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others")))
HouseData1
```
e. Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
subset(HouseData1[,c(2:3)], Sex == 2 & Fathers_Occupation == "Driver")
```
f. Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending
school. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
subset(HouseData1[,c(1,5)], Siblings_at_School >= 5)
```
4. Interpret the graph.
