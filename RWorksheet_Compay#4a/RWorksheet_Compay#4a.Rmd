1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
```{r}
shoe_size <- c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0)
height <-  c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 74.5, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 69.0, 72.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0)
gender <- c("F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M")

frame1 <- data.frame(Shoesize = shoe_size, Height = height, Gender = gender)
frame1
```
b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
What its result? Show the R scripts.
```{r}
female <- subset(frame1, Gender == "F", select = c(Shoesize, Height))
female

male <- subset(frame1, Gender == "M", select = c(Shoesize, Height))
male
```
c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
meanshoe <- mean(frame1$Shoesize)
meanshoe

meanheight <- mean(frame1$Height)
meanheight
```
d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
```{r}
relation <- cor(frame1$Shoesize, frame1$Height)
relation
```
2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
```{r}
months <- c("March", "April", "January", "November", "January", "September", "October", "September", "November", "August", "January", "November", "November", "February", "May", "August", "July", "December", "August", "August", "September", "November", "February", "April")

fmonths <- factor(months)
fmonths
```
3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
```{r}
smonths <- summary(months)
sfmonths <- summary(fmonths)

sfmonths
smonths
```
4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
```{r}
factor_data <- c(rep("East", 1), rep("West", 4), rep("North", 3))
new_order_data <- factor(factor_data, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))

new_order_data
```
5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv
a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.
b. View the data set. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
data <- read.table("import_march.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
data
```
6. Full Search
a. Create an R Program that allows the User to randomly select numbers from 1 to 50.
Then display the chosen number. If the number is beyond the range of the selected choice,
it will have to display a string “The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50”. If
number 20 is inputted by the User, it will have to display “TRUE”, otherwise display the
input number.
```{r}

exhaustive_search <- function() {
  chosen_number <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "Select a number between 1 and 50: "))
  
  if (is.na(chosen_number)) {
    cat("Please enter a valid number.\n")
    return()
  }
  
  cat("You selected:", chosen_number, "\n")
  
  if (chosen_number < 1 || chosen_number > 50) {
    cat("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50.\n")
  } else if (chosen_number == 20) {
    cat("TRUE\n")
  } else {
    cat(chosen_number)
  }
}

exhaustive_search()


```
7. Change
a. Write a function that prints the minimum number of bills that must be paid, given the
price of the snack.
Input: Price of snack (a random number divisible by 50) Output: Minimum number of bills
needed to purchase a snack.
```{r}
min_bills <- function(price) {
  bills <- c(1000, 500, 200, 100, 50)
  count <- 0
  
  for (bill in bills) {
    num_bills <- price %/% bill
    count <- count + num_bills
    price <- price %% bill
  }
  
  return(count)
}

snack_price <- as.numeric(readline(prompt = "Enter the price of the snack (divisible by 50): "))

if (!is.na(snack_price) && snack_price %% 50 == 0) {
  cat("Minimum number of bills needed:", min_bills(snack_price), "\n")
} else {
  cat("Price must be a number divisible by 50.\n")
}

```
8. The following is each student’s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the
following questions.
a. Create a dataframe from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}

name <- c("Annie","Thea","Steve","Hanna")
grade1 <- c(85, 65, 75, 95)
grade2 <- c(65, 75, 55, 75)
grade3 <- c(85, 90, 80, 100)
grade4 <- c(100, 90, 85, 90)

grades <- data.frame(Name = name, Grade1 = grade1, Grade2 = grade2, Grade4 = grade4)
grades


```
b. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average math score over 90 points during the semester. write R code and its output.
```{r}
average_scores <- (grades$Grade1 + grades$Grade2 + grades$Grade3 + grades$Grade4) / 4
students_above_90 <- grades[average_scores > 90, ]

if (nrow(students_above_90) > 0) {
    students_above_90_avg <- sum(average_scores[average_scores > 90]) / nrow(students_above_90)
} else {
    students_above_90_avg <- NA
}

students_above_90_avg
```
c. Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average
score was less than 80 out of 4 tests.
```{r}
name <- c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna")
grade1 <- c(85, 65, 75, 95)
grade2 <- c(65, 75, 55, 75)
grade3 <- c(85, 90, 80, 100)
grade4 <- c(100, 90, 85, 90)

grades <- data.frame(Name = name, Grade1 = grade1, Grade2 = grade2, Grade3 = grade3, Grade4 = grade4)

for (i in 1:nrow(grades)) {
  test_avg <- (grades[i, 2] + grades[i, 3] + grades[i, 4] + grades[i, 5]) / 4
  if (test_avg < 80) {
    cat("Name:", grades$Name[i], "- Average Score:", test_avg, "\n")
  }
}

```
d. Without using the max function, output as follows for students whose highest score for
a semester exceeds 90 points.
```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(grades)) {
  highest_score <- grades[i, 2]
  for (j in 3:5) {
    if (grades[i, j] > highest_score) {
      highest_score <- grades[i, j]
    }
  }
  if (highest_score > 90) {
    cat("Name:", grades$Name[i], "- Highest Score:", highest_score, "\n")
  }
}

```
